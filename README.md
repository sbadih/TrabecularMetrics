# TrabecularMetrics

This repository includes code for training a U-Net to segment trabecular bone from CBCT data. Trained model weight are also available for the U-Net. 
Code for second segmentation algorithm using Otsu thersholding is also available. Sample segmented results from the test set are stored as nifti volumes for both models. 
These segmnentation were obtained to calculate morphological metrics of trabecular bone (thickness, spacing, number) as referenced in Subramanian, S., et al.
